# SavTunesDatabase
   SavTunes is a working model of how a music management application would work in the real world. This project aims to create a working model of the app which will allow you to dynamically allocate memory for songs which means if the space is sufficient one could store as many songs as they wish to.       The project also want to showcase the sorting feature of a music management application and how you can sort the songs as per artists name, song name or even genre the user can decide that just like in the real world.       Lastly the project will to showcase a searching feature ,in the real world one would have more than 100 songs stored in the application and itâ€™s not feasible to make the user to scroll through each song until they find the correct one, hence with the searching feature they can enter any keyword in the song like the artists name or song name and the application will present all the songs that match the keyword.
